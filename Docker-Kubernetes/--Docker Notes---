--Docker Notes---
*****************

# docker ps : To check all the running containers

# docker run <image id> : It's an equivalent command to create and start a container

# docker ps --all : To check all the previously executed containers

# docker stop <container id> : Give a bit a time to stop the container (10 secs or else docker kill will be executed automatically)

# docker kill <container id> : Kills the execution of the container instantly

# Eg: Suppose you run a redis server image and now you want to access the redis server inside the container using redis cli 

docker run redis-server : This starts the redis server 

docker ps : gives you  the redis server container id

docker exec -it <container id> redis-cli : This allows you to enter the container and execute the redis-cli command. 
Once you have gained access to the container, you can access the redis server through redis-cli commands

What's the purpose of IT flag : It is actually -i -t. -i is generally used as an input to the container from the terminal. While -t
is the format of the output you get back on the terminal. -i -t is similar to -it

# docker exec -it <container id> sh : To open the terminal inside container. Very important. Majorly used for debugging purposes

# docker run -it busybox sh : Can be used while running the image as well. 

#! Suppose we have two containers running in parallel, do remember that both the containers do not share a common harddisk.
